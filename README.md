# Expense Tracker
This is a simple expense tracker I built using Python. It lets me add income and expenses, stores everything in a CSV file, and shows some useful visualizations like bar charts and pie charts to better understand where my money goes.

## Features

- Add income or expenses by category, date, and amount
- Data is saved in a CSV file so it's easy to track over time
- Monthly spending is displayed as a bar chart
- Expenses by category are shown in a pie chart
- Easy-to-use command-line interface

## How to Run

1. Install matplotlib if you donâ€™t have it:
   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib
